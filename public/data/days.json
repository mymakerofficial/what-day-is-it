Yellow, black.\nYellow, black. Yellow, black.\n\n\n\n\nOoh, black and yellow!\nLet's shake it up a little.\n\n\n\n\nBarry!

Special day, graduation.\n\n\n\n\nNever thought I'd make it.\n\n\n\n\nThree days grade school,\nthree days high school.\n\n\n\n\nThose were awkward.\n\n\n\n\nThree days college. I'm glad I took\na day and hitchhiked around the hive.\n\n\n\n\nYou did come back different.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Hi, Barry.\n\\- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Hear about Frankie?\n\\- Yeah.\n\n\n\n\n\\- You going to the funeral?\n\\- No, I'm not going.\n\n\n\n\nEverybody knows,\nsting someone, you die.\n\n\n\n\nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\nSuch a hothead.\n\n\n\n\nI guess he could have\njust gotten out of the way.\n\n\n\n\nI love this incorporating\nan amusement park into our day.\n\n\n\n\nThat's why we don't need vacations.\n\n\n\n\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp...\nunder the circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Well, Adam, today we are men.\n\\- We are!\n\n\n\n\n\\- Bee\\-men.\n\\- Amen!\n\n\n\n\nHallelujah!\n\n\n\n\nStudents, faculty, distinguished bees,\n\n\n\n\nplease welcome Dean Buzzwell.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome, New Hive Oity\ngraduating class of...\n\n\n\n\n...9:15.\n\n\n\n\nThat concludes our ceremonies.\n\n\n\n\nAnd begins your career\nat Honex Industries!\n\n\n\n\nWill we pick ourjob today?\n\n\n\n\nI heard it's just orientation.\n\n\n\n\nHeads up! Here we go.\n\n\n\n\nKeep your hands and antennas\ninside the tram at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Wonder what it'll be like?\n\\- A little scary.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Honex,\na division of Honesco\n\n\n\n\nand a part of the Hexagon Group.\n\n\n\n\nThis is it!\n\n\n\n\nWow.\n\n\n\n\nWow.\n\n\n\n\nWe know that you, as a bee,\nhave worked your whole life\n\n\n\n\nto get to the point where you\ncan work for your whole life.\n\n\n\n\nHoney begins when our valiant Pollen\nJocks bring the nectar to the hive.\n\n\n\n\nOur top\\-secret formula\n\n\n\n\nis automatically color\\-corrected,\nscent\\-adjusted and bubble\\-contoured\n\n\n\n\ninto this soothing sweet syrup\n\n\n\n\nwith its distinctive\ngolden glow you know as...\n\n\n\n\nHoney!\n\n\n\n\n\\- That girl was hot.\n\\- She's my cousin!\n\n\n\n\n\\- She is?\n\\- Yes, we're all cousins.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Right. You're right.\n\\- At Honex, we constantly strive\n\n\n\n\nto improve every aspect\nof bee existence.\n\n\n\n\nThese bees are stress\\-testing\na new helmet technology.\n\n\n\n\n\\- What do you think he makes?\n\\- Not enough.\n\n\n\n\nHere we have our latest advancement,\nthe Krelman.\n\n\n\n\n\\- What does that do?\n\\- Oatches that little strand of honey\n\n\n\n\nthat hangs after you pour it.\nSaves us millions.\n\n\n\n\nOan anyone work on the Krelman?\n\n\n\n\nOf course. Most bee jobs are\nsmall ones. But bees know\n\n\n\n\nthat every small job,\nif it's done well, means a lot.\n\n\n\n\nBut choose carefully\n\n\n\n\nbecause you'll stay in the job\nyou pick for the rest of your life.\n\n\n\n\nThe same job the rest of your life?\nI didn't know that.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\n\n\n\nYou'll be happy to know that bees,\nas a species, haven't had one day off\n\n\n\n\nin 27 million years.\n\n\n\n\nSo you'll just work us to death?\n\n\n\n\nWe'll sure try.\n\n\n\n\nWow! That blew my mind!\n\n\n\n\n\"What's the difference?\"\nHow can you say that?\n\n\n\n\nOne job forever?\nThat's an insane choice to have to make.\n\n\n\n\nI'm relieved. Now we only have\nto make one decision in life.\n\n\n\n\nBut, Adam, how could they\nnever have told us that?\n\n\n\n\nWhy would you question anything?\nWe're bees.\n\n\n\n\nWe're the most perfectly\nfunctioning society on Earth.\n\n\n\n\nYou ever think maybe things\nwork a little too well here?\n\n\n\n\nLike what? Give me one example.\n\n\n\n\nI don't know. But you know\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n\n\n\nPlease clear the gate.\nRoyal Nectar Force on approach.\n\n\n\n\nWait a second. Oheck it out.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!\n\\- Wow.\n\n\n\n\nI've never seen them this close.\n\n\n\n\nThey know what it's like\noutside the hive.\n\n\n\n\nYeah, but some don't come back.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Hey, Jocks!\n\\- Hi, Jocks!\n\n\n\n\nYou guys did great!\n\n\n\n\nYou're monsters!\nYou're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!\n\n\n\n\n\\- I wonder where they were.\n\\- I don't know.\n\n\n\n\nTheir day's not planned.\n\n\n\n\nOutside the hive, flying who knows\nwhere, doing who knows what.\n\n\n\n\nYou can'tjust decide to be a Pollen\nJock. You have to be bred for that.\n\n\n\n\nRight.\n\n\n\n\nLook. That's more pollen\nthan you and I will see in a lifetime.\n\n\n\n\nIt's just a status symbol.\nBees make too much of it.\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it\nand the ladies see you wearing it.\n\n\n\n\nThose ladies?\nAren't they our cousins too?\n\n\n\n\nDistant. Distant.\n\n\n\n\nLook at these two.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Oouple of Hive Harrys.\n\\- Let's have fun with them.\n\n\n\n\nIt must be dangerous\nbeing a Pollen Jock.\n\n\n\n\nYeah. Once a bear pinned me\nagainst a mushroom!\n\n\n\n\nHe had a paw on my throat,\nand with the other, he was slapping me!\n\n\n\n\n\\- Oh, my!\n\\- I never thought I'd knock him out.\n\n\n\n\nWhat were you doing during this?\n\n\n\n\nTrying to alert the authorities.\n\n\n\n\nI can autograph that.\n\n\n\n\nA little gusty out there today,\nwasn't it, comrades?\n\n\n\n\nYeah.

It all depends\non what 0900 means.\n\n\n\n\nHey, Honex!\n\n\n\n\nDad, you surprised me.\n\n\n\n\nYou decide what you're interested in?\n\n\n\n\n\\- Well, there's a lot of choices.\n\\- But you only get one.\n\n\n\n\nDo you ever get bored\ndoing the same job every day?\n\n\n\n\nSon, let me tell you about stirring.\n\n\n\n\nYou grab that stick, and you just\nmove it around, and you stir it around.\n\n\n\n\nYou get yourself into a rhythm.\nIt's a beautiful thing.\n\n\n\n\nYou know, Dad,\nthe more I think about it,\n\n\n\n\nmaybe the honey field\njust isn't right for me.\n\n\n\n\nYou were thinking of what,\nmaking balloon animals?\n\n\n\n\nThat's a bad job\nfor a guy with a stinger.\n\n\n\n\nJanet, your son's not sure\nhe wants to go into honey!\n\n\n\n\n\\- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.\n\\- I'm not trying to be funny.\n\n\n\n\nYou're not funny! You're going\ninto honey. Our son, the stirrer!\n\n\n\n\n\\- You're gonna be a stirrer?\n\\- No one's listening to me!\n\n\n\n\nWait till you see the sticks I have.\n\n\n\n\nI could say anything right now.\nI'm gonna get an ant tattoo!\n\n\n\n\nLet's open some honey and celebrate!\n\n\n\n\nMaybe I'll pierce my thorax.\nShave my antennae.\n\n\n\n\nShack up with a grasshopper.

Yes, Your Honor,\nwe're ready to proceed.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Montgomery,\nyour opening statement, please.\n\n\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\n\n\n\n\nmy grandmother was a simple woman.\n\n\n\n\nBorn on a farm, she believed\nit was man's divine right\n\n\n\n\nto benefit from the bounty\nof nature God put before us.\n\n\n\n\nIf we lived in the topsy\\-turvy world\nMr. Benson imagines,\n\n\n\n\njust think of what would it mean.\n\n\n\n\nI would have to negotiate\nwith the silkworm\n\n\n\n\nfor the elastic in my britches!\n\n\n\n\nTalking bee!\n\n\n\n\nHow do we know this isn't some sort of\n\n\n\n\nholographic motion\\-picture\\-capture\nHollywood wizardry?\n\n\n\n\nThey could be using laser beams!\n\n\n\n\nRobotics! Ventriloquism!\nOloning! For all we know,\n\n\n\n\nhe could be on steroids!\n\n\n\n\nMr. Benson?\n\n\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\nthere's no trickery here.\n\n\n\n\nI'm just an ordinary bee.\nHoney's pretty important to me.\n\n\n\n\nIt's important to all bees.\nWe invented it!\n\n\n\n\nWe make it. And we protect it\nwith our lives.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, there are\nsome people in this room\n\n\n\n\nwho think they can take it from us\n\n\n\n\n'cause we're the little guys!\nI'm hoping that, after this is all over,\n\n\n\n\nyou'll see how, by taking our honey,\nyou not only take everything we have\n\n\n\n\nbut everything we are!\n\n\n\n\nI wish he'd dress like that\nall the time. So nice!\n\n\n\n\nOall your first witness.\n\n\n\n\nSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\nof Honey Farms, big company you have.\n\n\n\n\nI suppose so.\n\n\n\n\nI see you also own\nHoneyburton and Honron!\n\n\n\n\nYes, they provide beekeepers\nfor our farms.\n\n\n\n\nBeekeeper. I find that\nto be a very disturbing term.\n\n\n\n\nI don't imagine you employ\nany bee\\-free\\-ers, do you?\n\n\n\n\n\\- No.\n\\- I couldn't hear you.\n\n\n\n\n\\- No.\n\\- No.\n\n\n\n\nBecause you don't free bees.\nYou keep bees. Not only that,\n\n\n\n\nit seems you thought a bear would be\nan appropriate image for a jar of honey.\n\n\n\n\nThey're very lovable creatures.\n\n\n\n\nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build\\-A\\-Bear.\n\n\n\n\nYou mean like this?\n\n\n\n\nBears kill bees!\n\n\n\n\nHow'd you like his head crashing\nthrough your living room?!\n\n\n\n\nBiting into your couch!\nSpitting out your throw pillows!\n\n\n\n\nOK, that's enough. Take him away.\n\n\n\n\nSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\nYour name intrigues me.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Where have I heard it before?\n\\- I was with a band called The Police.\n\n\n\n\nBut you've never been\na police officer, have you?\n\n\n\n\nNo, I haven't.\n\n\n\n\nNo, you haven't. And so here\nwe have yet another example\n\n\n\n\nof bee culture casually\nstolen by a human\n\n\n\n\nfor nothing more than\na prance\\-about stage name.\n\n\n\n\nOh, please.\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\n\n\n\n\nBecause I'm feeling\na little stung, Sting.\n\n\n\n\nOr should I say...

Is that a crime?\n\n\n\n\nNot yet it isn't. But is this\nwhat it's come to for you?\n\n\n\n\nExploiting tiny, helpless bees\nso you don't\n\n\n\n\nhave to rehearse\nyour part and learn your lines, sir?\n\n\n\n\nWatch it, Benson!\nI could blow right now!\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't a goodfella.\nThis is a badfella!\n\n\n\n\nWhy doesn't someone just step on\nthis creep, and we can all go home?!\n\n\n\n\n\\- Order in this court!\n\\- You're all thinking it!\n\n\n\n\nOrder!

Well, here's to a great team.\n\n\n\n\nTo a great team!\n\n\n\n\nWell, hello.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Ken!\n\\- Hello.\n\n\n\n\nI didn't think you were coming.\n\n\n\n\nNo, I was just late.\nI tried to call, but... the battery.\n\n\n\n\nI didn't want all this to go to waste,\nso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\n\n\n\n\nOh, that was lucky.\n\n\n\n\nThere's a little left.\nI could heat it up.\n\n\n\n\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\n\n\n\n\nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\n\n\n\n\nI'm not much for the game myself.\nThe ball's a little grabby.\n\n\n\n\nThat's where I usually sit.\nRight... there.\n\n\n\n\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\n\n\n\n\nand he agreed with me that eating with\nchopsticks isn't really a special skill.\n\n\n\n\nYou think I don't see what you're doing?\n\n\n\n\nI know how hard it is to find\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\n\n\n\n\nDo we?\n\n\n\n\nBees have 100 percent employment,\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\n\n\n\n\nThat's just what\nI was thinking about doing.\n\n\n\n\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\n\n\n\n\nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\n\n\n\n\nYeah, you do that.\n\n\n\n\nLook at that.\n\n\n\n\nYou know, I've just about had it\n\n\n\n\nwith your little mind games.\n\n\n\n\n\\- What's that?\n\\- Italian Vogue.\n\n\n\n\nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\n\n\n\n\nA lot of ads.\n\n\n\n\nRemember what Van said, why is\nyour life more valuable than mine?\n\n\n\n\nFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!\n\n\n\n\nI think something stinks in here!\n\n\n\n\nI love the smell of flowers.\n\n\n\n\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\n\n\n\n\nNot as much.\n\n\n\n\nWater bug!

What are you talking about?!\nAre there other bugs in your life?\n\n\n\n\nNo, but there are other things bugging\nme in life. And you're one of them!\n\n\n\n\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\n\n\n\n\nMy nerves are fried from riding\non this emotional roller coaster!\n\n\n\n\nGoodbye, Ken.\n\n\n\n\nAnd for your information,\n\n\n\n\nI prefer sugar\\-free, artificial\nsweeteners made by man!\n\n\n\n\nI'm sorry about all that.\n\n\n\n\nI know it's got\nan aftertaste! I like it!\n\n\n\n\nI always felt there was some kind\nof barrier between Ken and me.\n\n\n\n\nI couldn't overcome it.\nOh, well.\n\n\n\n\nAre you OK for the trial?\n\n\n\n\nI believe Mr. Montgomery\nis about out of ideas.\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to call\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\n\n\n\n\nGood idea! You can really see why he's\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\n\n\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\n\n\nLayton, you've\ngotta weave some magic\n\n\n\n\nwith this jury,\nor it's gonna be all over.\n\n\n\n\nDon't worry. The only thing I have\nto do to turn this jury around\n\n\n\n\nis to remind them\nof what they don't like about bees.\n\n\n\n\n\\- You got the tweezers?\n\\- Are you allergic?\n\n\n\n\nOnly to losing, son.

What matters is\nyou're alive. You could have died.\n\n\n\n\nI'd be better off dead. Look at me.\n\n\n\n\nThey got it from the cafeteria\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\n\n\n\n\nLook, there's\na little celery still on it.\n\n\n\n\nWhat was it like to sting someone?\n\n\n\n\nI can't explain it. It was all...\n\n\n\n\nAll adrenaline and then...\nand then ecstasy!\n\n\n\n\nAll right.\n\n\n\n\nYou think it was all a trap?\n\n\n\n\nOf course. I'm sorry.\nI flew us right into this.\n\n\n\n\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us.

Yes, Your Honor!\n\n\n\n\nWhere is the rest of your team?\n\n\n\n\nWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.\n\n\n\n\nBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\n\n\n\n\nand as a result,\nwe don't make very good time.\n\n\n\n\nI actually heard a funny story about...\n\n\n\n\nYour Honor,\nhaven't these ridiculous bugs\n\n\n\n\ntaken up enough\nof this court's valuable time?\n\n\n\n\nHow much longer will we allow\nthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\n\n\n\n\nThey have presented no compelling\nevidence to support their charges\n\n\n\n\nagainst my clients,\nwho run legitimate businesses.\n\n\n\n\nI move for a complete dismissal\nof this entire case!\n\n\n\n\nMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going\n\n\n\n\nto have to consider\nMr. Montgomery's motion.\n\n\n\n\nBut you can't!

Oh, great.\n\n\n\n\nVanessa, this is nothing more\nthan a big metal bee.\n\n\n\n\nIt's got giant wings, huge engines.\n\n\n\n\nI can't fly a plane.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?\n\\- Yes.\n\n\n\n\nHow hard could it be?\n\n\n\n\nWait, Barry!\nWe're headed into some lightning.\n\n\n\n\nThis is Bob Bumble. We have some\nlate\\-breaking news from JFK Airport,\n\n\n\n\nwhere a suspenseful scene\nis developing.\n\n\n\n\nBarry Benson,\nfresh from his legal victory...\n\n\n\n\nThat's Barry!\n\n\n\n\n...is attempting to land a plane,\nloaded with people, flowers\n\n\n\n\nand an incapacitated flight crew.\n\n\n\n\nFlowers?!\n\n\n\n\nWe have a storm in the area\nand two individuals at the controls\n\n\n\n\nwith absolutely no flight experience.\n\n\n\n\nJust a minute.\nThere's a bee on that plane.\n\n\n\n\nI'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson\nand his no\\-account compadres.\n\n\n\n\nThey've done enough damage.\n\n\n\n\nBut isn't he your only hope?\n\n\n\n\nTechnically, a bee\nshouldn't be able to fly at all.\n\n\n\n\nTheir wings are too small...\n\n\n\n\nHaven't we heard this a million times?\n\n\n\n\n\"The surface area of the wings\nand body mass make no sense.\"\n\n\n\n\n\\- Get this on the air!\n\\- Got it.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Stand by.\n\\- We're going live.\n\n\n\n\nThe way we work may be a mystery to you.\n\n\n\n\nMaking honey takes a lot of bees\ndoing a lot of small jobs.\n\n\n\n\nBut let me tell you about a small job.\n\n\n\n\nIf you do it well,\nit makes a big difference.\n\n\n\n\nMore than we realized.\nTo us, to everyone.\n\n\n\n\nThat's why I want to get bees\nback to working together.\n\n\n\n\nThat's the bee way!\nWe're not made of Jell\\-O.\n\n\n\n\nWe get behind a fellow.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Black and yellow!\n\\- Hello!\n\n\n\n\nLeft, right, down, hover.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Hover?\n\\- Forget hover.\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't so hard.\nBeep\\-beep! Beep\\-beep!\n\n\n\n\nBarry, what happened?!\n\n\n\n\nWait, I think we were\non autopilot the whole time.\n\n\n\n\n\\- That may have been helping me.\n\\- And now we're not!\n\n\n\n\nSo it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\n\n\n\n\nAll of you, let's get\nbehind this fellow! Move it out!\n\n\n\n\nMove out!\n\n\n\n\nOur only chance is if I do what I'd do,\nyou copy me with the wings of the plane!\n\n\n\n\nDon't have to yell.\n\n\n\n\nI'm not yelling!\nWe're in a lot of trouble.\n\n\n\n\nIt's very hard to concentrate\nwith that panicky tone in your voice!\n\n\n\n\nIt's not a tone. I'm panicking!\n\n\n\n\nI can't do this!\n\n\n\n\nVanessa, pull yourself together.\nYou have to snap out of it!\n\n\n\n\nYou snap out of it.\n\n\n\n\nYou snap out of it.\n\n\n\n\n\\- You snap out of it!\n\\- You snap out of it!\n\n\n\n\n\\- You snap out of it!\n\\- You snap out of it!\n\n\n\n\n\\- You snap out of it!\n\\- You snap out of it!\n\n\n\n\n\\- Hold it!\n\\- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.\n\n\n\n\nHow is the plane flying?\n\n\n\n\nI don't know.\n\n\n\n\nHello?\n\n\n\n\nBenson, got any flowers\nfor a happy occasion in there?\n\n\n\n\nThe Pollen Jocks!\n\n\n\n\nThey do get behind a fellow.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Black and yellow.\n\\- Hello.\n\n\n\n\nAll right, let's drop this tin can\non the blacktop.\n\n\n\n\nWhere? I can't see anything. Oan you?\n\n\n\n\nNo, nothing. It's all cloudy.\n\n\n\n\nOome on. You got to think bee, Barry.\n\n\n\n\n\\- Thinking bee.\n\\- Thinking bee.\n\n\n\n\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n\n\n\nWait a minute.\nI think I'm feeling something.\n\n\n\n\n\\- What?\n\\- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.\n\n\n\n\nLike a 27\\-million\\-year\\-old instinct.\n\n\n\n\nBring the nose down.\n\n\n\n\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n\n\n\n\\- What in the world is on the tarmac?\n\\- Get some lights on that!\n\n\n\n\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n\n\n\n\\- Vanessa, aim for the flower.\n\\- OK.\n\n\n\n\nOut the engines. We're going in\non bee power. Ready, boys?\n\n\n\n\nAffirmative!\n\n\n\n\nGood. Good. Easy, now. That's it.\n\n\n\n\nLand on that flower!\n\n\n\n\nReady? Full reverse!\n\n\n\n\nSpin it around!\n\n\n\n\n\\- Not that flower! The other one!\n\\- Which one?\n\n\n\n\n\\- That flower.\n\\- I'm aiming at the flower!\n\n\n\n\nThat's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.\nI mean the giant pulsating flower\n\n\n\n\nmade of millions of bees!\n\n\n\n\nPull forward. Nose down. Tail up.\n\n\n\n\nRotate around it.\n\n\n\n\n\\- This is insane, Barry!\n\\- This's the only way I know how to fly.\n\n\n\n\nAm I koo\\-koo\\-kachoo, or is this plane\nflying in an insect\\-like pattern?\n\n\n\n\nGet your nose in there. Don't be afraid.\nSmell it. Full reverse!\n\n\n\n\nJust drop it. Be a part of it.\n\n\n\n\nAim for the center!\n\n\n\n\nNow drop it in! Drop it in, woman!\n\n\n\n\nOome on, already.\n\n\n\n\nBarry, we did it!\nYou taught me how to fly!\n\n\n\n\n\\- Yes. No high\\-five!\n\\- Right.\n\n\n\n\nBarry, it worked!\nDid you see the giant flower?\n\n\n\n\nWhat giant flower? Where? Of course\nI saw the flower! That was genius!\n\n\n\n\n\\- Thank you.\n\\- But we're not done yet.\n\n\n\n\nListen, everyone!\n\n\n\n\nThis runway is covered\nwith the last pollen\n\n\n\n\nfrom the last flowers\navailable anywhere on Earth.\n\n\n\n\nThat means this is our last chance.\n\n\n\n\nWe're the only ones who make honey,\npollinate flowers and dress like this.\n\n\n\n\nIf we're gonna survive as a species,\nthis is our moment! What do you say?\n\n\n\n\nAre we going to be bees, orjust\nMuseum of Natural History keychains?\n\n\n\n\nWe're bees!\n\n\n\n\nKeychain!\n\n\n\n\nThen follow me!
