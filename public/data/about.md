### The accident
In 1998 an accident accrued within the day factory causing a failure of the day allocation machineâ„¢. Since then the days were occasionally scrambled and were not making sense all the time.

Put into a difficult position, their business basically ruined, the management decided against closing their business and instead did their best and kept on going. What they did not expect however was that the occasional mismatch of days made the experience of finding out what day it is all the more exiting.

 
### Where are they now?
Some might call it crazy but today their business is more successful than ever. They are still making new days every day.
Who would have thought that making "wrong" days would be more successful than correct days?
